# QRFx - finding the best way to waste my time
## i mean i made this for the FR8 selection round 2... a simple project
this project is not made to fix *any* broken qr image.  
i haven't taken generalization of the algo into consideration. I solely made this project to fix a qr code (single) I already had which wasn't working  
and i wanted to fix it and have it functioning properly, also create a digitized version of it.  
by doing this i'd learn opencv and id get even more better at python (and learn a lot).
